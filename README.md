Map, reduce, sort, filter - methods

## map

map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. 
map() calls a function once for each element in an array. 
map() does not execute the function for empty elements. map() does not change the original array.

### reduce

The reduce() method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. 
The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.

#### sort

The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the reference to the same array, now sorted.

##### filter

The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
